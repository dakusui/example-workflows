### Per-subfolder breakdown

Leaf counts exclude shared/; the shared/ row is the cost amortised across all three groups.

## Verification

PASS — 6/6 files match.

## Findings

### Scope

Three workflow groups were refactored: `deploy-cloudrun` (4 files),
`create-cloud-deploy-release` (1 file), and `get-gke-credentials` (1 file).
Kubernetes/Knative manifests and Cloud Deploy config files that happened to
live in the same directories were explicitly excluded from scope — they are
supporting artefacts, not workflow definitions.

### Shared workflow base (`cloudrun-workflow-base.yaml++`)

All five workflow files share the same `on.push.branches` trigger, job
`permissions`, `runs-on`, and three env vars (`PROJECT_ID`, `SERVICE`,
`REGION`). These were extracted into a single document-level base used by
every leaf via `$extends` at the document root.

### GAR image reference functions (`cloudrun.jq`)

The Google Artifact Registry image string
(`$GAR_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/…:$GITHUB_SHA`) appeared in three
distinct patterns across the workflows:

| Function | Image path pattern | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `gar_image` | `…/SERVICE:sha` | deploy-cloudrun (declarative) |
| `gar_image_with_repo` | `…/REPOSITORY/SERVICE:sha` | deploy-cloudrun (docker, buildpacks) |
| `gar_image_with_app` | `…/APP/APP:sha` | create-cloud-deploy-release |

Each function is paired with a `build_and_push_*` variant that composes the
full two-line `docker build / docker push` shell script. jq's `\()`
interpolation was required here because jq++ cannot interpolate `eval:`
directives as substrings inside block scalars
(see [dakusui/jqplusplus#59](https://github.com/dakusui/jqplusplus/issues/59)).
Leaf files reference these via `eval:string:cloudrun::…`, keeping the `run:`
values to a single clean line.

### Step-level node inheritance

jq++ supports `$extends` at the array-element level (node-level inheritance),
not only at the document root. This was the primary mechanism for factoring
repeated GitHub Actions steps. Seven shared step bases were extracted:

| Base file | Fields in base | Variant overrides used |
|---|---|---|
| `steps/google-auth-step.yaml++` | name, id, uses @v0, WIF with fields | `token_format`, `name`, `uses @v1`, hardcoded WIF values |
| `steps/docker-auth-step.yaml++` | name, id, uses @v1, username/password/registry | `uses @v2` |
| `steps/checkout-step.yaml++` | name, uses @v3 | `uses @v2` |
| `steps/show-output-step.yaml++` | name, run | — |
| `steps/build-and-push-step.yaml++` | name, run (`build_and_push`) | `run` → `build_and_push_with_repo` |
| `steps/build-and-push-app-step.yaml++` | name, run (`build_and_push_with_app`) | — |
| `steps/deploy-cloudrun-step.yaml++` | name, id, uses @v0, service, region | `uses @v2`, `with.image`, `with.metadata`, `with.source` |

The step files live under `shared/steps/` and are referenced with the
`steps/` path prefix (e.g. `steps/checkout-step.yaml++`), which resolves
through the existing `shared/` JF_PATH entry without any additional
configuration.

### Per-subfolder outcomes

**deploy-cloudrun** (−44% lines, −53% words) — the biggest win. Four files
with heavily overlapping structure: same trigger, same permissions, same five
action steps differing in at most two fields per step. Every action step in
this group is now backed by a shared base; leaf files express only what
differs. `cloudrun-source` shrank to 18 lines (from 33 generated) by inheriting
almost everything.

**create-cloud-deploy-release** (−18% lines, −22% words) — moderate savings.
The workflow inherits the common base and uses the new `build-and-push-app-step`
and `checkout-step` bases. The remaining bulk (gcloud CLI steps for Cloud Deploy
pipeline management, release creation, manifest rendering) is unique to this
workflow and was left inline.

**get-gke-credentials** (≈0%) — effectively neutral. The Google Auth and
Checkout steps were factored, but the majority of the workflow (Docker login,
Build with `--build-arg` flags, Publish, Kustomize setup, kubectl deploy) is
unique to GKE and used only once. Inline is the correct choice for single-use
steps. The small line increase is the overhead of `$extends` directive lines
being slightly more verbose than the inline equivalents they replace.

### Limitations

- **Block scalar interpolation**: `eval:` directives are not interpolated when
  they appear as substrings within YAML block scalars (`|-`). The workaround is
  to promote the entire value to an `eval:string:` expression using jq's `\()`
  interpolation. Reported upstream as dakusui/jqplusplus#59.
- **Array merging**: jq++ deep-merges objects but shallow-replaces arrays. Base
  `steps: []` arrays are fully replaced by the leaf; this is the expected
  behaviour but it means array-level inheritance (inserting a step into a base
  sequence) is not available.
- **YAML comments stripped**: The jq++ → yq round-trip removes all comments.
  The generated baseline therefore reflects comment-free output; savings
  measured against the originals would appear larger due to stripped comments.
